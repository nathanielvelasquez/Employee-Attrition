Which feature is the most important determinant for employee attrition? 
What is the likelihood that an employee wil leave the company?

This project trains a logistic regression model to analyze the Kaggle dataset 
"IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance", sorts feature importances,
and creates an equation to predict what percent chance an employee will quit.
